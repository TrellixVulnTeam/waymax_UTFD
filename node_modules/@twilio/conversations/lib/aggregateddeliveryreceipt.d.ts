 * @classdesc Contains aggregated information about a {@link Message}'s delivery statuses across all {@link Participant}s
 * of a {@link Conversation}.
 *
 * At any moment during delivering message to a {@link Participant} the message can have zero or more of following
 * delivery statuses:
 *
 * <ul><li>
 * Message considered as <b>sent</b> to a participant, if the nearest upstream carrier accepted the message.
 * </li><li>
 * Message considered as <b>delivered</b> to a participant, if Twilio has received confirmation of message
 * delivery from the upstream carrier, and, where available, the destination handset.
 * </li><li>
 * Message considered as <b>undelivered</b> to a participant, if Twilio has received a delivery receipt
 * indicating that the message was not delivered. This can happen for many reasons including carrier content
 * filtering and the availability of the destination handset.
 * </li><li>
 * Message considered as <b>read</b> by a participant, if the message has been delivered and opened by the
 * recipient in the conversation. The recipient must have enabled read receipts.
 * </li><li>
 * Message considered as <b>failed</b> to be delivered to a participant if the message could not be sent.
 * This can happen for various reasons including queue overflows, account suspensions and media
 * errors (in the case of MMS for instance).
 *</li></ul>
